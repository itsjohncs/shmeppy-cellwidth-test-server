# Shmeppy Cell Width Test Server

Shmeppy uses a novel algorithm to detect grid lines in an image and determine the width between those grid lines (which I call the "cell width").

This is a server used by my test harnesses of that algorithm.

There is no reason for this repo to be public, it's not going to be useful to anyone else, but there's also no reason for it to be private so 🤷‍♀️.
